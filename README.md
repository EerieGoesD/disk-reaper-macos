## Features

### Large Files
Scan any folder (or your entire disk) for large files. Sort by size, filter by type, delete or reveal in Finder. Right-click any file for quick actions.

### Installed Apps
Lists all apps in `/Applications` with their real on-disk size (including support files). Uninstall apps you no longer need.

### Processes
Live view of all running processes with CPU, memory, and full command info. Right-click to kill a process or kill its entire tree.

### Services
Browse and manage launchd agents and daemons. Start or stop background services without touching the terminal.

### Cleaner
One-click system maintenance tasks:

| Task | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Free Up RAM** | Purges inactive memory via `purge` (requires admin) |
| **Free Up Purgeable Space** | Trims local Time Machine snapshots |
| **Run Maintenance Tasks** | Clears user & system caches, temp files, rebuilds Launch Services DB, clears QuickLook cache, rotates logs, removes `.DS_Store` files |
| **Flush DNS Cache** | Flushes DNS resolver cache and restarts `mDNSResponder` |
| **Speed Up Mail** | Vacuums the Apple Mail SQLite database |
| **Reindex Spotlight** | Erases and rebuilds the Spotlight index |
| **Repair Disk Permissions** | Runs `fsck_apfs` verification on the startup volume |
